# Geographic Map Feature Added to Dashboard

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Feature:** Interactive US map showing sample distribution by ZIP code

---

## What Was Added

### üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Distribution Section

Added a new map visualization to the **"üìà Overview & Statistics"** tab that displays:

1. **Interactive US Map**: Shows sample concentration across the country
   - Bubble size represents number of samples per ZIP code
   - Color intensity indicates sample density
   - Hover for detailed information (ZIP, city, state, sample count, coordinates)

2. **Summary Metrics**:
   - Total samples with ZIP codes (14,857)
   - Number of unique ZIP codes (798)
   - Most common ZIP code
   - Sample count in top location

3. **Top 10 Locations Table**: Displays the cities/states with most samples

4. **Fallback Options**:
   - If geocoding library unavailable, shows bar chart of top 20 ZIPs
   - Graceful degradation with informative messages

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `uszipcode>=1.0.1,<2.0` - US ZIP code geocoding library
- `sqlalchemy>=1.4.0,<2.0` - Database toolkit (required by uszipcode)
- `sqlalchemy-mate>=1.4.28.4,<2.0` - SQLAlchemy extensions (required by uszipcode)
- `plotly>=5.18.0` - Already required, used for map visualization
- `streamlit>=1.28.0` - Already required, dashboard framework

**Note**: Version constraints ensure compatibility between uszipcode and SQLAlchemy.

### Key Features
- **Caching**: Geocoding results are cached to improve performance
- **Performance Optimization**: Limits to top 200 ZIP codes for fast rendering
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if geocoding fails
- **Data Validation**: Handles missing/invalid ZIP codes

### Code Location
- **File**: `agwise_eda/dashboard/app.py`
- **Lines**: 169-296 (Geographic Distribution section)
- **Dependencies**: Lines 19-24 (uszipcode import)

## How to Use

### Access the Map
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8504 (or Network URL: http://192.168.3.203:8504)
2. Select **"üìà Overview & Statistics"** from the sidebar
3. Scroll down to the **"üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Distribution of Samples"** section
4. The map will automatically load and geocode ZIP codes (cached after first load)

### Interactive Features
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or +/- buttons
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around the map
- **Hover**: Mouse over bubbles to see details
- **Export**: Use camera icon to save as PNG

### Interpreting the Map
- **Bubble Size**: Larger bubbles = more samples from that location
- **Color**: Darker green = higher sample concentration
- **Geographic Scope**: Automatically focused on USA
- **Coverage**: Shows top 200 ZIP codes by sample count

## Data Insights from Map

Based on the 14,857 samples with valid ZIP codes across 798 unique locations:

- **Sample Coverage**: 39.8% of total dataset (37,310 samples) has ZIP code data
- **Geographic Distribution**: Samples span across multiple US states
- **Concentration**: Some ZIP codes have significantly higher sample counts
- **Regional Patterns**: Map reveals regional clusters of agricultural testing

## Installation & Setup

### If Geocoding Not Working

The dashboard will show a warning if `uszipcode` is not installed. To fix:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/deyus-ex-machina/agwise
source venv/bin/activate

# Install uszipcode
pip install uszipcode

# Restart dashboard
pkill -f "streamlit run agwise_eda/dashboard/app.py"
streamlit run agwise_eda/dashboard/app.py --server.headless true --server.port 8504
```

### First-Time Setup
The `uszipcode` library downloads a small database (~50MB) on first use. This happens automatically and is cached locally.

---

## Performance Notes

- **Initial Load**: First geocoding takes 5-10 seconds (one-time per session)
- **Cached Load**: Subsequent loads are instant (<1 second)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact, ~50MB for ZIP code database
- **Rendering**: Top 200 ZIPs rendered for optimal performance
- **Scalability**: Can handle full 798 unique ZIPs if needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **State-Level Aggregation**: Add option to view by state
2. **Time Series**: Animate sample collection over time
3. **Soil Health Overlay**: Color by average soil health score
4. **County Boundaries**: Show county-level aggregations
5. **Custom Filtering**: Allow users to filter by date range or metrics
6. **Export Options**: Download geocoded data as CSV
7. **Clustering Analysis**: Identify regional patterns automatically
