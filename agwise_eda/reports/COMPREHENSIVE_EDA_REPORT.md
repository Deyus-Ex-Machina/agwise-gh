- **Sample Type:** Predominantly "SOIL HEALTH" (392 samples, 99%)
- **Depth Range:** 0-6 inches (most common)
- **Test ID Coverage:** 99.94% missing (suggests internal tracking codes not consistently exported)

---

## 2. Data Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Missing Data Patterns

**Critical Finding:** Extensive missing data across many variables, particularly in specialized measurements.

**Completely Missing (100% null):**
- All enzyme activity measurements (10 variables):
  - Beta Glucosidase, Urease, Phosphodiesterase
  - Dehydrogenase, Fluorescein Diacetate Hydrolysis
  - Beta Glucosaminidase, Phosphomonoesterases (Acid/Alkaline)
  - Arylsulfatase, Enzyme Soil Moisture %

**Highly Missing (>95%):**
- Crop 3 recommendations: 99.7% missing
- Crop 2 recommendations: 98.2% missing
- Crop 1 recommendations: 95.2% missing
- Past Crop information: 95.2% missing

**Moderately Available Data:**
- Core soil health metrics (V1): 89.08% missing (396 samples available)
- Core soil health metrics (V2): Complete for 1,600 samples
- Cover Crop Mix: 68.8% missing (1,131 samples available)

**Implications for Analysis:**
1. Enzyme activity data cannot be analyzed (no data present)
2. Crop recommendation analysis limited to small subset
3. Two distinct testing cohorts identified (V1: 396 samples, V2: 1,600 samples)
4. Primary analysis should focus on variables with >1,000 observations

### 2.2 Duplicate Analysis

**Findings:**
- **Total Duplicates:** 1,674 rows (46.18% of dataset)
- **Unique Samples:** 1,951
- **Duplicates by Key Fields (Lab No, Date Recd, Date Rept):** 1,701 (46.92%)

**Interpretation:**
The high duplication rate suggests:
1. Multiple test types performed on same samples
2. Different depth measurements from same location
3. Repeated tests over time
4. Data export artifacts

**Recommendation:** For the inheriting data scientist:
- Investigate duplication logic before aggregation
- Consider creating a unique sample identifier based on Lab No + Date + Depth
- Determine if duplicates represent temporal measurements or should be deduplicated

### 2.3 Outlier Detection

Analysis using IQR method (outliers defined as values beyond Q1-1.5×IQR or Q3+1.5×IQR):

| Metric | Outliers | % | Notable Pattern |
|--------|----------|---|-----------------|
| Organic Matter % LOI | 60 | 15.2% | High-OM soils significantly above typical range |
| Soil Health Score | 56 | 14.1% | Excellent performers (10-23 score range) |
| Soil Respiration ppm CO2-C | 51 | 12.9% | High biological activity outliers |
| H3A Calcium ppm Ca | 50 | 12.6% | Calcium-rich alkaline soils |
| Soil pH 1:1 | 35 | 8.8% | Extreme acidic and alkaline outliers |

**Key Insight:** Outliers in organic matter and soil respiration strongly correlate with exceptional soil health scores, suggesting these are legitimate high-performers rather than data errors.

## 5. Categorical Analysis

### 5.1 Cover Crop Mix Distribution

**Dataset Split:** Two versions with different coverage

**Cover Crop Mix (n=1,131):**
- 40% Legume / 60% Grass: 206 samples (18.2%)
- 60% Legume / 40% Grass: 196 samples (17.3%)
- 50% Legume / 50% Grass: 181 samples (16.0%)
- 10% Legume / 90% Grass: 173 samples (15.3%)
- 70% Legume / 30% Grass: 167 samples (14.8%)
- 30% Legume / 70% Grass: 119 samples (10.5%)
- 20% Legume / 80% Grass: 89 samples (7.9%)

**Cover crop mix (n=826):**
- 50% Legume / 50% Grass: 255 samples (30.9%)
- 60% Legume / 40% Grass: 251 samples (30.4%)
- 70% Legume / 30% Grass: 134 samples (16.2%)
- Others: <10% each

### 5.2 Soil Health by Cover Crop Mix

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Cover crop legume percentage shows inverse relationship with soil health score.

**Soil Health Scores by Mix (Cover Crop Mix variable):**

| Mix | n | Mean Score | Median | Std Dev | Range |
|-----|---|------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 20% Legume / 80% Grass | 2 | **21.90** | 21.90 | 1.04 | 21.17-22.64 |
| 30% Legume / 70% Grass | 7 | **18.21** | 18.21 | 1.45 | 15.80-19.72 |
| 40% Legume / 60% Grass | 4 | **12.60** | 12.94 | 1.11 | 10.98-13.52 |
| 50% Legume / 50% Grass | 6 | 7.28 | 7.32 | 1.47 | 5.31-9.44 |
| 10% Legume / 90% Grass | 80 | 2.92 | 2.29 | 2.64 | 1.46-15.80 |
| 60% Legume / 40% Grass | 106 | 2.43 | 2.56 | 0.82 | 1.09-4.77 |
| 70% Legume / 30% Grass | 160 | 1.99 | 2.01 | 0.32 | 1.13-2.49 |

**Interpretation:**
1. **Grass-dominant mixes (20-40% legume) achieve highest scores**
2. Legume-dominant mixes (60-70% legume) show lowest average scores
3. High-grass mixes may promote better carbon sequestration and soil structure
4. Sample sizes vary significantly - 20-40% legume mixes have fewer samples

**Hypothesis:** Grass-dominated cover crops may:
- Provide more stable, longer-lasting organic matter
- Create better soil structure through fibrous root systems
- Support more diverse microbial communities
- Maintain carbon inputs over longer periods

**Note for Inheriting Data Scientist:** This finding contradicts conventional wisdom that legume-heavy mixes improve soil health through nitrogen fixation. Requires validation with:
1. Temporal analysis (how long were covers in place?)
2. Previous crop history analysis
3. Statistical significance testing (some groups have small n)
4. Confounding variable investigation

### 5.3 Crop Recommendations

**Limited Data Warning:** Crop recommendations only available for 4.8% of samples.

**Top Recommended Crops (Crop 1, n=173):**

|------|---|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Corn | 51 | 117.4 | 37.5 | 44.8 |
| Soybeans | 25 | 0.0 | 23.8 | 48.4 |
| Wheat | 13 | 45.4 | 13.8 | 2.7 |
| Cool Season Grass | 8 | 71.3 | 23.1 | 10.0 |
| Bermuda Grass | 7 | 75.7 | 5.7 | 17.1 |

**Key Patterns:**
1. Soybeans receive 0 nitrogen (relying on biological fixation)
2. Corn receives highest N (117 lbs/A) and P (37 lbs/A) recommendations
3. Soybeans receive highest K recommendations (48 lbs/A)
4. Grass crops receive moderate, balanced recommendations

### 5.5 Past Crop Analysis

**Distribution (n=173):**
- All Other Crops: 122 samples (70.5%)
- Soybeans: 39 samples (22.5%)
- Corn: 5 samples (2.9%)
- Cover Crop Mix: 4 samples (2.3%)
- Alfalfa: 3 samples (1.7%)

## 6. Advanced Insights

### 6.1 Traditional vs Haney Test Nitrogen Recommendations

**MAJOR FINDING:** Haney Test consistently recommends more nitrogen than Traditional testing.

**Comparison (n=1,600):**

| Metric | Traditional Test | Haney Test | Difference |
|--------|------------------|------------|------------|
| Mean | 27.93 lbs/A | 60.32 lbs/A | +32.40 lbs/A |
| Median | 13.17 lbs/A | 44.16 lbs/A | +24.87 lbs/A |

**Economic Impact:**
- Mean savings per sample: $31.95
- Median savings per sample: $24.56
- **Total potential savings: $51,113.57**

**Interpretation:**
The Haney Test methodology accounts for:
1. Biologically available nitrogen (not just chemical extraction)
2. Soil respiration and microbial activity
3. Water-extractable organic nitrogen
4. More realistic plant-available N estimates

**Critical Question:** Why is the "difference" positive if Haney recommends MORE nitrogen?

**Answer:** The data labels suggest this represents:
- Traditional Test overestimates plant-available N
- Haney Test provides more accurate assessment
- "Savings" may represent avoided over-application and environmental costs
- OR: Data interpretation error requiring verification

**Action Item for Inheriting Scientist:** Verify the directionality and meaning of "N Difference" and "N Savings" with laboratory documentation.

### 6.2 Organic Matter Impact on Soil Health

**Correlation: r=0.871 (Very Strong)**

**Organic Matter Categories and Health:**
- Soils with OM >3% consistently score higher on health metrics
- Every 1% increase in OM associated with ~2.5 point increase in health score
- OM appears to work synergistically with biological activity

**Mechanism:**
1. Organic matter provides carbon substrate for microbes
2. Increases water holding capacity
3. Improves soil structure and aggregation
4. Buffers pH and nutrient availability
5. Supports microbial diversity

### 6.3 pH Impact on Soil Biology

**Correlation with Soil Health Score: r=-0.726 (Strong Negative)**

**pH Categories (n=396):**
- Acidic (<5.5): 5 samples (1.3%)
- Slightly Acidic (5.5-6.5): 17 samples (4.3%)
- Neutral (6.5-7.5): 17 samples (4.3%)
- **Alkaline (7.5+): 357 samples (90.2%)**

**Problem:** Extreme alkalinity (90% of samples pH >7.5) presents multiple challenges:
1. Reduced microbial activity (most soil microbes prefer pH 6-7)
2. Limited nutrient availability (Fe, Mn, Zn, P)
3. Lower organic matter decomposition rates
4. Reduced nitrogen fixation by legumes

**Geographic Inference:** Dataset likely from arid/semi-arid region or limestone-based soils (Western US, calcareous soils).

### 6.4 Nutrient Balance Insights

**N-P-K Ratios:**
- N:P = 0.95 (median) - Relatively balanced
- N:K = 0.62 (median) - Potassium abundant relative to nitrogen
- P:K = 0.67 (median) - Potassium exceeds phosphorus

**Comparison to Optimal Plant Uptake Ratios (approximate):**
- Most crops require N:P:K roughly 5:1:3
- Data shows N:P:K roughly 1:1:1.1 (median-based)

**Implication:** Nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient in this dataset, while P and K are relatively more available.

---

## 7. Data Distribution Patterns

### 7.1 Skewness Analysis

**Right-Skewed Distributions (positive skew):**
- Soil Respiration (mean >> median: 16.9 vs 7.3)
- Soil Health Score (mean >> median: 3.5 vs 2.2)
- All nutrient availability metrics (N, P, K)
- Organic matter content

**Interpretation:**
- Most samples cluster at lower values
- Small number of exceptional high-performers
- Typical of environmental data
- Suggests significant opportunity for improvement

### 7.2 Multimodal Patterns

**Potential Bimodal Distribution:** Soil Health Score shows two clusters:
1. Poor-Fair cluster (1-5): 87% of samples
2. Excellent cluster (10-23): 8% of samples

**Hypothesis:** These may represent:
1. Different soil types (agricultural vs managed)
2. Different management intensities
3. Different geographic regions
4. Before/after intervention comparisons

**Recommendation:** Investigate what differentiates the high-performing cluster (scores >10).

## 11. Limitations and Caveats

### 11.1 Data Limitations

1. **High Duplication (46%):** Unknown whether true replicates or artifacts
2. **Extensive Missing Data:** Crop info >95% missing, enzyme data 100% missing
3. **No Geographic Information:** Cannot assess spatial patterns or regional effects
4. **Limited Temporal Data:** Unclear if samples represent time series or cross-section
5. **Small Sample Sizes:** Some cover crop groups have n<10
6. **Unbalanced Design:** Not all combinations of factors represented equally

### 11.2 Analytical Limitations

1. **Correlation ≠ Causation:** Relationships identified are associative, not causal
2. **No Statistical Testing:** Effect sizes reported without significance tests
3. **No Confound Control:** Observed relationships may be influenced by unmeasured variables
4. **Outlier Retention:** Outliers not removed, may influence summary statistics
5. **Missing Data Handling:** Complete case analysis only; no imputation performed

### 11.3 Interpretation Caveats

1. **Cover Crop Finding:** Grass-dominant superiority requires validation due to:
   - Small sample sizes in best-performing groups
   - Possible confounding with soil type or region
   - Unknown temporal relationships (when were covers planted?)

2. **Traditional vs Haney:** Direction of "savings" unclear; requires verification

3. **Alkaline Soil Bias:** 90% alkaline samples may not generalize to other regions

4. **Enzyme Data:** Complete absence prevents comprehensive biological assessment

### 11.4 Generalizability

Results apply to:
- ✓ Agricultural soils in arid/semi-arid regions
- ✓ Alkaline, calcium-rich soils
- ✓ Cover crop management systems
- ✓ Haney soil health testing methodology

Results may not generalize to:
- ✗ Acidic soils (only 6% of samples)
- ✗ High-rainfall regions
- ✗ Different soil testing methods
- ✗ Organic or highly managed systems

## 12. Conclusions

This comprehensive EDA reveals a dataset rich in soil health information with clear patterns and actionable insights, despite significant data quality challenges. The analysis identifies three primary opportunities:

### 12.1 Soil Health Improvement Pathway
With 87% of soils rating "Poor" to "Fair," there exists substantial opportunity for soil health intervention. The strong relationships between organic matter, biological activity, and health scores provide a clear roadmap: increase carbon inputs, stimulate microbial communities, and manage pH.

### 12.2 Testing Methodology Optimization
The Haney Test appears to provide more nuanced nitrogen recommendations than traditional testing, with potential economic benefits averaging $32 per sample. Validating and adopting this methodology could optimize fertilizer inputs and reduce environmental impacts.

### 12.3 Cover Crop Strategy
The unexpected finding that grass-dominant cover crop mixes outperform legume-dominant mixtures challenges conventional recommendations and warrants further investigation. If validated, this could reshape cover crop selection strategies.
