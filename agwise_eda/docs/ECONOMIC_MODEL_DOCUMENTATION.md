## Mathematical Model

### 1. Testing Cost Structure

#### 1.1 Annual Testing Cost

```
Annual_Test_Cost = (Cost_per_Sample × Samples_per_Field × Depths) / Testing_Frequency

where:
    Cost_per_Sample = Laboratory charge per sample ($)
    Samples_per_Field = Number of sampling locations
    Depths = Number of depth increments sampled
    Testing_Frequency = How often testing occurs (years)
```

**Typical Values:**
- Haney Test: $45-65/sample (default: $50)
- Traditional Test: $20-35/sample (default: $25)
- Samples per Field: 2-8 (default: 4)
- Depths: 1-2 (default: 1, representing 0-6")
- Frequency: 2-4 years (default: 3)

**Literature Support:**
- Ward Laboratories: $55 for Haney test (2024 pricing)
- Midwest Labs: $50-60 for Haney test
- Traditional NPK test: $20-30 typical

#### 1.2 Per-Acre Testing Cost

```
Test_Cost_per_Acre = Annual_Test_Cost / Field_Size_Acres
```

**Sensitivity:** Testing cost per acre decreases with field size, making Haney testing more economical for larger fields.

### 2. Nitrogen Recommendation Difference

#### 2.1 Core Principle

The Haney test measures biologically available nitrogen through water extraction and soil respiration, providing a more accurate assessment than traditional chemical extraction methods.

```
ΔN = N_Available_Haney - N_Recommendation_Traditional

where:
    N_Available_Haney = Available N from Haney test (lbs/acre)
    N_Recommendation_Traditional = N rec from traditional test (lbs/acre)
    ΔN = Difference in nitrogen availability (typically positive)
```

**Observed Data (from 12,684 samples):**
- Mean ΔN: +33.17 lbs/acre
- Median ΔN: +26.73 lbs/acre
- Range: -50 to +150 lbs/acre
- Standard Deviation: 45 lbs/acre

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive ΔN:** Haney detects more plant-available N than traditional test
- **Implication:** Traditional test may lead to over-recommendation of fertilizer
- **Confidence:** Based on 3,942 paired samples in dataset

**Literature Support:**
- Haney et al. (2012): Haney test showed 25-40% higher available N in diverse soils
- Franzluebbers (2016): Water-extractable organic N better predictor of mineralization
- NRCS (2019): Haney test recommended for assessing biological N contribution

### 3. Fertilizer Cost Savings

#### 3.1 Direct Fertilizer Savings

```
Fertilizer_Savings = ΔN × N_Price × Field_Size_Acres

where:
    N_Price = Cost per lb of nitrogen fertilizer ($/lb)
```

**Nitrogen Pricing (2024-2025):**
- Anhydrous Ammonia (82% N): $0.48-0.65/lb N
- Urea (46% N): $0.60-0.85/lb N
- UAN 28% solution: $0.70-0.95/lb N
- Default model: $0.75/lb N (mid-range)

**Calculation Example:**
```
Field: 80 acres
ΔN: 33 lbs/acre
N_Price: $0.75/lb

Savings = 33 × 0.75 × 80 = $1,980 per field
Per acre = $24.75/acre
```

#### 3.2 Application Cost Savings

When N savings exceed ~15 lbs/acre, farmers may reduce application trips or equipment use.

```
Application_Savings = (ΔN / Typical_Rate) × Application_Cost × Field_Size

where:
    Typical_Rate = 100-150 lbs N/acre (crop-dependent)
    Application_Cost = $8-15/acre (custom or equipment cost)
```

**Conservative Approach:**
- Only credited if ΔN > 10 lbs/acre
- Assumes partial trip savings (not full elimination)
- Default: $12/acre × (ΔN/100)

---

### 4. Precision Value & Risk Mitigation

#### 4.1 Improved N Management Precision

More accurate N assessment reduces both under-application risk (yield loss) and over-application risk (waste, environmental).

```
Precision_Value = ΔN × Precision_Factor × N_Use_Efficiency × Yield_Response × Crop_Price

where:
    Precision_Factor = 0.2 (conservative: 20% of difference represents true management improvement)
    N_Use_Efficiency = 0.40-0.60 (crop-specific, default 0.50 for corn)
    Yield_Response = 0.5-1.5 bu/lb N (diminishing returns curve, default 1.0)
    Crop_Price = Market price of crop ($/bu)
```

**Rationale:**
- Not all ΔN is "waste" in traditional systems (some may be appropriate)
- Precision_Factor (20%) represents conservative estimate of actual improvement
- Captures value of avoiding both over- and under-application

**Literature Support:**
- Sawyer et al. (2006): Corn N use efficiency typically 40-60%
- Cassman et al. (2002): Yield response to N follows diminishing returns
- Morris et al. (2018): Economic optimum N rate critical for profitability

#### 4.2 Example Calculation (Corn)

```
ΔN = 33 lbs/acre
Precision_Factor = 0.2
N_Use_Efficiency = 0.50
Yield_Response = 1.0 bu/lb N
Corn_Price = $5.50/bu

Precision_Value = 33 × 0.2 × 0.50 × 1.0 × 5.50 = $18.15/acre
```

### 5. Environmental Cost Savings

#### 5.1 Avoided Environmental Costs

Excess nitrogen not taken up by crops poses environmental risks:
- Nitrate leaching to groundwater
- N₂O emissions (potent greenhouse gas)
- Surface water runoff and eutrophication
- Regulatory compliance costs

```
Environmental_Savings = |ΔN| × Environmental_Cost_per_lb

where:
    Environmental_Cost_per_lb = $0.05-0.20/lb N (literature range)
    Default = $0.10/lb N
```

**Cost Components:**
- **Direct:** Water quality monitoring, treatment costs
- **Indirect:** Ecosystem services degradation, regulatory risk
- **Social:** Carbon footprint, sustainability reputation

**Literature Support:**
- Keeler et al. (2016): External cost of N loss: $0.15-0.45/lb depending on pathway
- Compton et al. (2011): Social cost of agricultural N: $0.10-0.30/lb
- van Grinsven et al. (2013): European N cost estimates: €1.50-3.00/kg ($0.13-0.25/lb)

**Conservative Approach:**
- Model uses lower end of range ($0.10/lb)
- Reflects growing regulatory and market pressure on sustainability
- Captures risk mitigation value even if not immediately monetized

### 6. Net Economic Benefit

#### 6.1 Total Annual Benefit

```
Annual_Net_Benefit = (Fertilizer_Savings + Application_Savings + Precision_Value + Environmental_Savings) - Additional_Test_Cost

where:
    Additional_Test_Cost = (Haney_Cost - Traditional_Cost) / Amortization_Period
```

#### 6.2 Return on Investment (ROI)

```
ROI_Annual = (Annual_Net_Benefit / Additional_Test_Investment) × 100%

ROI_Multi_Year = (Annual_Net_Benefit × Years / Total_Test_Investment) × 100%
```

#### 6.3 Break-Even Analysis

```
Break_Even_Acres = Additional_Test_Cost / Savings_per_Acre

where:
    Savings_per_Acre = ΔN × N_Price + other per-acre savings
```

**Decision Rules:**
1. **Positive ROI (>0%):** Consider adoption
2. **ROI >50%:** Strong economic case
3. **ROI >100%:** Excellent investment
4. **Break-even < Actual Field Size:** Economics favor Haney
