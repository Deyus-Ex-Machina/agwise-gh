## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Soil Health Status
- **87% of soils** rate "Poor" to "Fair"
- Mean score: 3.54 (median: 2.24)
- Only **13% achieve "Good" or "Excellent"**
- Major improvement opportunity identified

### 2️⃣ Critical Drivers of Soil Health
- **Soil Respiration** (r=0.952) - strongest predictor
- **Organic Matter** (r=0.871) - second strongest
- **Alkaline pH** (r=-0.726) - negative impact
- High calcium associated with lower health

### 3️⃣ Cover Crop Surprise Finding
- **Grass-dominant mixes** (20-40% legume) → highest scores
- **Legume-dominant mixes** (60-70% legume) → lowest scores
- Counterintuitive result requires validation
- Small sample sizes in best performers

### 4️⃣ Economic Insights
- Haney Test: 60.3 lbs/A nitrogen (mean)
- Traditional Test: 27.9 lbs/A nitrogen (mean)
- Difference: **+32.4 lbs/A** with Haney
- **Potential savings: $31.95/sample**
- **Total dataset savings: $51,113.57**

### 5️⃣ Soil Characteristics
- **90% alkaline** (pH >7.5) - regional pattern
- **Nitrogen is limiting** - most constrained nutrient
- P and K relatively abundant
- High variability (diverse management histories)
